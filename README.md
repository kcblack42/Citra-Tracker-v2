Tracker for Gen 6/7 Pokémon Ironmon.
    Pokémon X/Y, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Sun/Moon, Pokémon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon

How to Use:

Citra emulator for 3DS is required. Drop the files in the folder into the citra scripting folder(the one with a citra.py inside, usually in appdata/local) and run the citra-updater.py file via Python. Then, either direct your favorite browser (tested only on Firefox and Chrome) to http://localhost:8000/tracker.html or add a browser source in OBS directly. Citra must have a ROM open for the tracker to check for data.

This is currently a separate window that updates automatically every 10 seconds when ran correctly. The party mode automatically displays all the mons in your party, while the left and right arrows scroll between them. If there are any opponent mons, it also displays them and allows note-taking, with some automation.The game is automatically detected.

Hovering/clicking on ceratin areas displays extra data about the mons, such as the move name displaying data about the move.


Keep in mind this is an alpha version, do not expect perfection right now.

Big thanks to brdy for creating the display used here, and his database for the data. Additionally, thanks to UTDZac for helping with some of the features being imported from Citra, and [this](https://github.com/EverOddish/PokeStreamer-Tools) for the citra party data.

Python interface is required link [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
